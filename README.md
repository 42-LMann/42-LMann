Hey thanks for Visiting!

I'm Lachlan Mann but feel free to call me Lochie.

Currently I'm based in 42 Adelaide and have a absolute passion for it.

My interests are in...
    - Reading: Currently "lost Connection" by Johann Hari
    - Netball: Mixed C grade
    - Gaming: Currently Total War Warhammer 2

This Git account will host a combination of 42 projects that are concurrent (finished and work in progress (WiP)) as well as side hustle projects (most will be work in progress (WiP)).

The 42 projects will be avaliable for viewing to the public, I just ask for you to not out right plagiarise and ask before hand for the larger projects. The side hustle projects will be released to the individual upon request.
