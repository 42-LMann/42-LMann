## Coding Ethos

    - Patience is needed with C
    - The more ways you can write a set of code, the better 
        (create a coding style unique to you but also effective)
    - If in doubt - research/(trial and error)

My interests are in...

    - Reading: Currently "lost Connection" by Johann Hari
    - Netball: Mixed B grade
    - Gaming: factorio
    
# Current Projects

## Primary 42 Project
