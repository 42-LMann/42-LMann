# Lachlan Mann - 42 Student


## About Me

I'm Lachlan Mann (23), Currently I'm based in 42 Adelaide (have a absolute passion for it.) and currently studying C and looking into python and javascript

## Coding Ethos

    - Patience is needed with C
    - The more ways you can write a set of code, the better 
        (create a coding style unique to you but also effective)
    - If in doubt - research/trial and error

My interests are in...
    - Reading: Currently "lost Connection" by Johann Hari
    - Netball: Mixed B grade
    - Gaming: Currently Total War Warhammer 2
    
# Current Projects

This Git account will host a combination of 42 projects that are concurrent (finished and work in progress (WiP)) as well as side hustle projects (most will be work in progress (WiP)).

## Primary 42 Project
    - Born2Beroot
    - ft_printf(being evaluated)
    
## Secondary Projects
    - Bug Tracker (using functions within libft and printf) that can be operated through the bash
        - creating sub functions (fprintf, fopen, fclose)

The 42 projects will be avaliable for your viewing, I just ask for you to not out right plagiarise and ask before hand for the larger projects. The side hustle projects will be released to the individual upon request.
